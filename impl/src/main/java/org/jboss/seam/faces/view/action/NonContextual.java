/**
 * This class handles non-contextual injection for a thirdparty framework.
 * 
 * <p>For each non-contextual type you want to provide CDI services (like injection, &#064;PostConstruct, &#064;PreDestroy) to, you need to
 * create an instance of this class. You'll need to pass in the BeanManager; assuming you are in a EE environment, the easiest
 * way to do this is to look it up in JNDI - java:comp/BeanManager, otherwise you'll have to resort to some non-portable method.
 * You then need to ensure to call nonContextual.newInstance() to create an instance. You can then use (the order here is
 * recommended) produce(), inject(), postConstruct(), preDestroy(), dispose() to create and cleanup the instance. Call get() to
 * get the instance.</p> 
 * 
 * See also http://seamframework.org/Documentation/HowDoIDoNoncontextualInjectionForAThirdpartyFramework.
